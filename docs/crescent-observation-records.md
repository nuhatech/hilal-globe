## 1. Naked Eye Records

### Youngest Waxing Crescent (After New Moon)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Observer** | Stephen James O'Meara |
| **Date** | 25 February 1990 (Sha'ban 1410 AH) |
| **Location** | Collins Gap, Tennessee, USA |
| **Moon Age (Geocentric)** | 15 hours 33 minutes |
| **Moon Age (Topocentric)** | 15 hours 01 minute |
| **Elongation at First Visibility** | 7.7° |
| **Relative Altitude (Best Time)** | 7.6° |
| **Relative Azimuth (Best Time)** | 0.6° |
| **Source** | Prof. Bradley Schaefer's papers; verified by ICOP |

O'Meara was already renowned for extraordinary visual acuity — he was the first person to sight Halley's Comet on its 1985 return. This record has stood for over 35 years and remains unbroken. The elongation of 7.7° sits right at the Danjon limit for naked-eye visibility, meaning this observation is near the theoretical maximum of what is physically possible.

### Historical Claim (Unverified)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Observers** | Two British housemaids (names unrecorded) |
| **Date** | 1916 |
| **Location** | England |
| **Moon Age** | ~14 hours 45 minutes |
| **Status** | Widely regarded as doubtful; no corroborating data |

This claim predates modern verification methods and is generally not accepted by the astronomical community as a reliable record.

## 2. Optical Aid Records (Binoculars / Telescope — Visual)

### Youngest Waxing Crescent — Binoculars

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Observer** | Mohsen G. Mirsaeed |
| **Date** | 7 September 2002 (Rajab 1423 AH) |
| **Location** | Mountain site near Tehran, Iran |
| **Moon Age** | 11 hours 40 minutes |
| **Elongation** | 7.5° |
| **Equipment** | 40×150 binoculars |
| **Duration of Observation** | ~1 minute |
| **Source** | ICOP; Mirsaeed is also author of the CSVC record tables |

Mirsaeed observed from a high-altitude mountain site to maximise horizon dip and reduce atmospheric extinction. The giant 40×150 binoculars provided both the magnification and light-gathering power needed to resolve a crescent at just 7.5° elongation — barely above the Danjon limit. The crescent was held in view for approximately one minute before being lost.

### Youngest Waxing Crescent — Telescope (After Sunset)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Observer** | Jim Stamm |
| **Date** | 22–23 March 2012 (Jumada al-Awwal 1433 AH) |
| **Location** | Tucson, Arizona, USA |
| **Elevation** | ~837 m |
| **Moon Age (Topocentric)** | 12 hours 23 minutes |
| **Moon Age (Geocentric)** | 11 hours 17 minutes |
| **Elongation at Last Visibility** | 6.0° |
| **Relative Altitude** | 5.0° |
| **Equipment** | 8″ Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope |
| **Source** | ICOP |

This is the ICOP record for youngest geocentric age seen through a telescope. The elongation of 6.0° is below Odeh's empirical Danjon limit of 6.4° for optical aid, making this an exceptional observation. Note: this was a waxing crescent observed in the evening sky.

### Youngest Waxing Crescent — Telescope (Daylight, Not Visible After Sunset)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Observer** | Jim Stamm |
| **Date** | 11 October 2007 (Shawwal 1428 AH) |
| **Location** | Tucson, Arizona, USA |
| **Elevation** | ~837 m |
| **Moon Age (Topocentric)** | 16 hours 17 minutes |
| **Moon Age (Geocentric)** | 16 hours 39 minutes |
| **Elongation at First Visibility** | 8.8° |
| **Moon Altitude at First Visibility** | 34.1° |
| **Sun Altitude at First Visibility** | 36.8° |
| **Equipment** | 8″ telescope |
| **Note** | Crescent seen only in daylight; **not visible** after sunset despite clear sky |
| **Source** | ICOP |

This observation is significant because it demonstrates that a crescent can sometimes be detected telescopically during daytime but remain invisible after sunset due to unfavourable horizon geometry.

### Smallest Lag Time — Telescope

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Observer** | Abbas Ahmadian |
| **Date** | Ramadan 1428 AH (2007) |
| **Location** | Esfahan, Iran |
| **Equipment** | 14″ telescope |
| **Moon Age (Topocentric, Best Time)** | 25 hours 11 minutes |
| **Moon Age (Geocentric, Best Time)** | 26 hours 16 minutes |
| **Elongation (Best Time)** | 12.1° |
| **Source** | ICOP |

## 3. CCD / Digital Imaging Records

### At the Moment of New Moon (Age = 0)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Observer** | Thierry Legault |
| **Date** | 8 July 2013 (Sha'ban 1434 AH) |
| **Location** | Élancourt, France |
| **Moon Age** | 0 hours 0 minutes (captured at the precise instant of geocentric conjunction) |
| **Elongation** | 4.4° |
| **Equipment** | Takahashi FSQ-106ED refractor (D=106mm, F=400mm), Lumenera Skynyx L2-2 monochrome CCD camera, low-pass infrared filter (850nm), pierced sun-blocking screen |
| **Technique** | Near-infrared imaging with image stacking; sun blocked by baffled screen |
| **Source** | Legault's website; Sky & Telescope; ICOP |

This record can only be duplicated, never surpassed — you cannot photograph the Moon younger than the instant of conjunction. Legault used near-infrared wavelengths to maximise contrast against the bright daytime sky, with a physical baffle to prevent direct sunlight from entering the telescope. The Moon was only 4.4° from the Sun, requiring extreme caution and precision.

### Before Conjunction (Negative Age — Old Waning Crescent)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Observer** | Thierry Legault |
| **Date** | 14 April 2010 (Jumada al-Ula 1431 AH) |
| **Location** | Montfaucon, France |
| **Elevation** | 300 m |
| **Moon Age (Topocentric)** | −0 hours 53 minutes (53 minutes **before** conjunction) |
| **Equipment** | Takahashi FSQ-106ED, Lumenera Skynyx CCD, IR filter 850nm |
| **Technique** | Same near-infrared CCD technique as 2013 record |
| **Source** | ICOP |

This earlier Legault observation captured the waning crescent just before the moment of new moon — a "negative age" crescent that was still technically the old moon.

### Earliest CCD Detection — Martin Elsässer

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Observer** | Martin Elsässer (with colleagues at Munich Public Observatory) |
| **Date** | 5 May 2008 |
| **Location** | Volkssternwarte München (Munich Public Observatory), Germany |
| **Equipment** | Williams FLT110 refractor (D=110mm, F=770mm), DMK41AF02.AS CCD camera, visual/IR filter (transmission from 680nm), MAM 50 mount, custom sun-blocking baffle |
| **Technique** | CCD video imaging with infrared filtration and image processing |
| **Achievement** | Imaged crescent minutes before geocentric conjunction |
| **Source** | mondatlas.de |

Elsässer pioneered the technique of automated CCD crescent detection using optimised image processing software. His setup at Munich became a benchmark for systematic daylight crescent imaging. He has repeatedly captured crescents at elongations of 5–7°, well below the visual Danjon limit.

### Daylight CCD — Bosscha Observatory

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Institution** | Bosscha Observatory, Institut Teknologi Bandung |
| **Location** | Lembang, West Java, Indonesia |
| **Active Since** | 2007 (CCD crescent programme since 2013) |
| **Smallest Elongation Achieved** | ~4° |
| **Equipment** | Small telescope + CCD camera with Johnson/Bessel I-filter |
| **Technique** | Infrared contrast enhancement; automated detection pipeline |
| **Significance** | Demonstrated that elongation ≥ 4° is routinely detectable with CCD |
| **Source** | Published in peer-reviewed proceedings (2019) |

The Bosscha programme showed that with modern CCD techniques, detection of crescents at elongations previously considered impossible is now routine, fundamentally challenging traditional notions of the Danjon limit for instrumented observations.

## 6. Key Physical Context

### The Danjon Limit

The Danjon limit defines the minimum Sun-Moon elongation at which any crescent can physically exist. Different researchers have proposed different values:

| Researcher | Danjon Limit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Danjon (1936) | 7.0° | Original; attributed to lunar mountain shadows |
| McNally (1983) | 5.0° | Attributed to atmospheric seeing |
| Schaefer (1991) | 7.5° | Cusp brightness falloff |
| Fatoohi et al. (1998) | 7.5° | Revised from observational records |
| Odeh (2004) | 6.4° optical / 7.7° naked eye | From ICOP database of 737 observations |
| Sultan (2007) | 5.0° | — |
| Hasanzadeh (2012) | ~5° | Based on new observational data |

For **naked eye** observations, the effective limit is approximately 7.5°–8°. For **optical aid** (telescope), the limit drops to about 6°–6.5°. For **CCD imaging** with infrared filters, detection has been achieved at elongations as low as 4°, but these are not "visible" crescents — they are detected only through digital image processing.

### Why Age Alone Is Misleading

As Schaefer (1996) and Odeh (2004) demonstrated, **moon age has no reliable predictive value** for crescent visibility on its own. A 20-hour-old moon at apogee with poor ecliptic angle can be harder to see than a 16-hour-old moon at perigee with steep ecliptic. The critical parameters are:

- **Elongation** (angular separation from Sun)
- **ARCV** (arc of vision — altitude difference between Moon and Sun)
- **Crescent width** (W) — determined by elongation and Earth-Moon distance
- **Ecliptic angle** to horizon (seasonal/latitudinal)
- **Atmospheric conditions** (transparency, extinction)
- **Observer elevation** (horizon dip, reduced extinction)

Moon age is reported here because it is the traditional metric and allows comparison across records, but the elongation values are the physically meaningful parameter.

### Factors That Enabled the Records

| Factor | Effect on Record Attempts |
|---|---|
| **High elevation** | Mirsaeed observed from a mountain; Stamm at 837m in Tucson |
| **Perigee timing** | Moon at perigee moves away from Sun faster, reaches critical elongation sooner |
| **Steep ecliptic** | Spring in northern hemisphere tilts the Moon's path steeply above the western horizon |
| **Moon north of ecliptic** | Adds extra altitude above the horizon |
| **Infrared imaging** | Dramatically improves contrast against bright sky (Legault, Elsässer, Bosscha) |
| **Image stacking** | CCD observers stack hundreds of frames to extract signal from noise |
| **Desert/mountain sites** | Low humidity, high transparency (Tucson, Iran, mountains) |
